# python_django_demo
Used Selenium and Django to build a basic site that stores user data via POST, includes functional and unit testing.

Hello,

If you're reading this, firstly, thank you! I'm glad you're interested in reviewing this Django project.

It is currently ongoing, but so far a lot has been accomplished.  If you're interested in running the app on a machine at home, I suggest looking at the deploy_tools/provisioning_notes.md to see all the required packages.

The development process is based on writing two sets of tests: functional (user-side), and unit (programmer-side) based.  You can find examples of expected user experience so far in the commented portions of the functional_test.py file.

Right now the current stage of development is working on automation so that new versions of the site can be deployed rapidly in the future --> and this also involves beefing up security! Fun stuff.  I'll keep you posted as progress is made.  You can also get an idea of the overall process by checking out the commit messages.  Thanks again for checking it out!
